Chapter 2 - Customization

[Section 1 - New in this context message fix for Remembering by Aaron Reed

The Remembering replace did not make sense in that context rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the noun did not make sense in that context error (this is the customized Remembering replace did not make sense in that context rule):
	if the player's command includes "call" or the player's command includes "dial" or the player's command includes "ring" or the player's command includes "text" or the player's command includes "message":
		make no decision;
	otherwise:
		now the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error;
		make no decision.
		
Does the player mean remembering something (called the memory):
	if the memory is in the location, it is very unlikely;
	it is possible.]

Section 1 - New postures definitions (in place of Section 1 - The Concept in Postures by Emily Short)

A posture is a kind of value. The postures are seated, standing, crouched, and reclining.

A person has a posture. The posture of a person is usually standing.

Section 2 - Autosave & conclusions files

When play begins (this is the set the autosave file rule): now the autosave filename is "studio_autosave".

Table of Final Question Options (continued) 
final question wording	only if victorious	topic	final response rule	final response activity
"RESET to the beginning of the night"	false	"reset"	reset the night rule	--

This is the reset the night rule:
	clear only the main screen;
	autorestore the game.
	
The File of Conclusions is called "studioconclusions".

When play begins:
	choose a row with a final response rule of list endings rule in the Table of Final Question Options;
	now the final response rule entry is the adapted list endings rule.
	
This is the adapted list endings rule:
	read the endings;
	sort the Table of Possible Endings in description order;
	say "The endings you have encountered so far include: [paragraph break]";
	repeat through the Table of Possible Endings:
		say "  [description entry][line break]".
		
[To say (X - text) with roman numerals:
	let T be "[X]";
	repeat through the Table of Roman numerals:
		if T matches the text "[numeral entry]":
			replace the matched text with "[replacement entry]";
	say T.
		
Table of Roman Numerals

Section 3 - Mention things that are running but should not be
[NOTE: Pulled pretty much verbatim from Modern Conveniences by Emily Short]

A last description-concealing rule (this is the running things aren't scenery rule): 
	now every visible open refrigerator is marked for listing;
	now every visible switched on tap is marked for listing.
	
Rule for writing a topic sentence about an open refrigerator (called item):
	say "[The item] [stand] open, letting all the cold air out. ";
	if the number of things in the item is 0:
		say "[There's] nothing inside. ";
		
Rule for writing a paragraph about a switched on tap (called item):
	say "[The item] [are] running. [nobr]";
	if the item is included by a sink (called basin):
		unless the number of mentionable things in basin is 0:
			now the current-subject is basin;
			choose row 2 in the relevant table;
			say "[disclosure entry][run paragraph on]";
	say "[paragraph break]".
	
A ranking rule for an open refrigerator (called special-target): 
	increase description-rank of the special-target by 1.
	
A ranking rule for a switched on tap (called special-target): 
	increase description-rank of the special-target by 1.

Book 2 - Values

Chapter 1 - Relations

Obscuring relates various things to various things. The verb to obscure means the obscuring relation.
[NOTE: This enables hiding behind and under things to be meaningful.]

Connectivity relates rooms to each other. The verb to be connected with means the connectivity relation.
[NOTE: Since many of our "rooms" represent locations within one continuous area, this will allow characters to see around in large areas.]

Awareness relates various people to various things. The verb to be aware of means the awareness relation.
[NOTE: This allows the intruder to notice your effect on the environment, and potentially suss you out if you aren't subtle enough.]

Inclusion relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when Y is part of X. The verb to include (it includes, they include, it included, it is included) implies the inclusion relation.
[NOTE: Lifted directly from Modern Conveniences, and included (no pun intended) to make sure other code from that extension works.]

Illumination relates various things to various rooms. The verb to illuminate means the illumination relation.
Wiring relates one device to one thing. The verb to be wired to means the wiring relation. The verb to be powered by means the reversed wiring relation.
[NOTE: These relations make lightswitches and lighting work]

A thing can be bright. A thing is seldom bright.
A room can be brightened or dim. A room is usually brightened.
[NOTE: To keep track of whether the lights are on without forcing the player into darkness.]

A thing can be unimportant. A thing is seldom unimportant.
[NOTE: This covers things that reasonably should be present, but will have exactly zero bearing on the game]

A thing can be noisemaking or soundless. A thing is usually soundless.
[NOTE: noisemaking things become the 'annoyance' of the intruder, and he'll stop what he's doing to go turn them off]

A thing can be electronic. A thing is seldom electronic. A computer is usually electronic.
[NOTE: For more intelligent refusals, especially about getting things wet]

Definition: a thing is sizable if the bulk of it is greater than 10.

Carry out examining (this is the mark items as examined on examining rule): if the noun is a thing, now the noun is examined.

Section 2 - Default location

A thing has an object called the default location.

When play begins (this is the initially set default locations rule):
	repeat with obj running through things:
		now the default location of obj is the holder of obj.
		
To decide whether (obj - a thing) is in-place:
	if the holder of obj is the default location of obj, decide yes;
	decide no.
	
Section 3 - Most recent mention

The most-recent-mention is a thing that varies.

After printing the name of something (called special-target): now the most-recent-mention is the special-target.
	
Section 4 - Scenes
	
To decide whether it's/its (X - a scene):

Rule for printing the name of a room (called place) while asking which do you mean: say "[casual descriptor of place]".

Section 6 - Noisiness

noisiness is a kind of value. the noisinesses are silent, quiet, moderate, loud, and thunderous.
A noisiness can be notable or disregardable. A noisiness is usually disregardable. loud and thunderous are notable.

A thing has a noisiness called the noise volume. The noise volume of a thing is usually silent.

A room has a noisiness called the ambient noise level. The ambient noise level of a room is usually quiet.
Definition: a room (called place) is noisy if the ambient noise level of place is notable.

To increase ambient noise: now the ambient noise level of the location is the noisiness after the ambient noise level of the location.
To decrease ambient noise: now the ambient noise level of the location is the noisiness before the ambient noise level of the location.
To increase the ambient noise of (place - a room): now the ambient noise level of place is the noisiness after the ambient noise level of place.
To decrease the ambient noise of (place - a room): now the ambient noise level of place is the noisiness before the ambient noise level of place.

Section 7 - Matching
[NOTE: Pulled from Example 370 in the Inform Recipe Book]

Definition: a direction is matched if it fits the parse list. 
Definition: a room is matched if it fits the parse list. 
Definition: a thing is matched if it fits the parse list. 

To decide whether (N - an object) fits the parse list: 
    (- (FindInParseList({N})) -)

Include (- 
#ifndef FindInParseList;
[ FindInParseList obj i k marker; 
    marker = 0;  
    for (i=1 : i<=number_of_classes : i++) { 
    while (((match_classes-->marker) ~= i) && ((match_classes-->marker) ~= -i)) marker++; 
    k = match_list-->marker;  
    if (k==obj) rtrue; 
    } 
    rfalse; 
]; 
#endif;
-)

Rule for asking which do you mean when everything matched is direction:
	say "In which direction?"
	
The Remembering don't disambiguate while remembering rule does nothing when something matched is touchable.

Does the player mean doing something when the noun is not enclosed by the location: it is unlikely.
Does the player mean doing something when the second noun is not nothing and the second noun is not enclosed by the location: it is unlikely.

Rule for reaching inside a room while remembering: allow access.
Rule for reaching inside a closed container while remembering: allow access.
[Before trying remembering a direction (called way): try going way instead.]

Section 8 - Bulk-capacity for undersides and backsides

The bulk-capacity of an underside is usually 50.

The bulk-capacity of a backside is usually 200.

Section 9 - Taking no time

abort-turn-sequence is a truth state that varies. abort-turn-sequence is initially false.

This is the abort turn sequence rule:
	if abort-turn-sequence is true:
		now abort-turn-sequence is false;
		rule succeeds.
		
The abort turn sequence rule is listed before the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rules.

To take no time: now abort-turn-sequence is true.

Section 10 - pulled from Helpful Functions by Daniel Stelzer

To decide whether we/there is/are/should/need a/an/the/-- (X - a truth state):
	decide on whether or not X is true.
To decide whether we/there don't/isn't/aren't/shouldn't need/have/-- a/an/the/-- (X - a truth state):
	decide on whether or not X is false.
	
[To decide whether (txt - indexed text) matches (top - topic): [This is a horrible, horrible hack by Vaporware. You can only compare topics to snippets, so this snippetifies indexed text to make a comparison.]
	let tmp be indexed text;
	let tmp be the player's command;
	change the text of the player's command to txt;
	let result be whether or not the player's command matches top;
	change the text of the player's command to tmp;
	decide on result.]
	
Section 11 - Pulled from Large Game Speedup by Nathanael Nerode

Definition: a container is empty rather than non-empty if the first thing held by it is nothing.
Definition: a supporter is empty rather than non-empty if the first thing held by it is nothing.

Chapter 4 - with great thanks to Zed Lopez

a dummy-thing is a thing.

a thing has a list of action names called the dispatch-me-not.
a thing has a thing called the dispatch-proxy.
the dispatch-proxy of a thing is usually the dummy-thing.

This is the dispatch rule:
	if the noun is something:
		if the action name part of the current action is not listed in the dispatch-me-not of the noun:
			if the dispatch-proxy of the noun is not the dummy-thing:
				now the noun is the dispatch-proxy of the noun;
				try the current action instead.

To dispatch everything but (l - a list of action names) for/from/of (item - thing) to (proxy - thing):
	now the dispatch-me-not of item is l;
	now the dispatch-proxy of item is the proxy;
  
the dispatch rule is listed before the before stage rule in the action-processing rules.

[Section 1 -  Debugging

This is the just checking in rule:
	say "The noun is [noun].";
	say "[action name part of the current action].";
	if the noun is a thing, say "[dispatch-me-not of the noun]";
	
the just checking in rule is listed before the dispatch rule in the action-processing rules.

last before:
	say "The noun is [noun].";
	if the noun is a thing, say "[dispatch-me-not of the noun]";]

Section 4 - Drawers

[NOTE: A good amount of the code around disambiguation and automation came from Automated Drawers by Emily Short.

A drawer is a kind of container. A drawer is usually openable and closed. Understand "[something related by reversed incorporation] drawer" as a drawer. Understand "drawer of [something related by reversed incorporation]" as a drawer. Understand "drawers" as the plural of drawer. The bulk-capacity of a drawer is usually 15.

A drawer has some text called the described-position.

Rule for printing the name of a drawer (called target) while asking which do you mean (this is the abbreviating drawer names for special situations rule):
	let N be the number of things which incorporate matched drawers;
	if N is 1:
		if target is fourth dresser drawer or target is second desk drawer:
			say "[described-position of target] drawer" (A);

			say "[described-position of target]" (B);
	otherwise if the number of matched drawers is N:

Does the player mean opening a closed drawer (this is the prefer to open closed drawers rule): it is very likely.
Does the player mean opening an open drawer (this is the avoid opening open drawers rule): it is very unlikely.
Does the player mean closing an open drawer (this is the prefer to close open drawers rule): it is very likely.
Does the player mean closing a closed drawer (this is the avoid closing closed drawers rule): it is very unlikely.

Rule for asking which do you mean when everything matched is a drawer (this is the identify drawers by ordinals when disambiguating rule):
	let N be the number of matched things enclosed by the location;
	if N > 0:
		say "Which drawer do you mean, the [nobr]";
		repeat with sel running from 1 to N:
			say "[ordinal of sel][nobr]";
			if sel is N minus 1:
				if sel is 1:
					say " or the [nobr]";
				otherwise:
					say ", or [nobr]";
			otherwise if sel is N:
				say "?";
			otherwise:
				say ", [nobr]";
	otherwise:
		say "There [adapt the verb are from the third person plural] no drawers in reach."

To say ordinal of (N - a number):
	if N is a number listed in the Table of Ordinals:
		choose row with a number of N in the Table of Ordinals;
		say ordinal entry;

number	ordinal
1	"first"
2	"second"
3	"third"
4	"fourth"

			take no time;
			say "[regarding the open drawers incorporated by the noun][if N is 1]The drawer [are][otherwise if N is 2]Both drawers [are][otherwise]Every drawer [are][end if] open already." (A);
	otherwise:

	let C be the number of closed drawers which are part of the special-target;
	let N be indexed text;
	if O is greater than C and C is greater than zero:
		let N be "[C in words] [if C is 1][adapt the verb are from the third person singular][otherwise][adapt the verb are from the third person plural][end if] closed, and the other [O in words] [adapt the verb are from the third person plural] open.";

	[i]Studio[/i] is a horror game, intended for mature audiences only. More specific information about its content can be found by typing CONTENT.
	
	For  information about parser IF in general, type ABOUT IF. Even if you're familiar with the format, you may want to type COMMANDS to see a list of non-standard commands used in this game.
	
	A note to seasoned IF players: due to the way [i]Studio[/i] handles action processing and input, it is not recommended that you enter multiple commands on the same line. Doing so may cause otherwise valid commands to be unrecognized, or have unintended in-game consequences."

Section 2 - About IF

	[i]Studio[/i] is parser IF, which means you interact with the world by typing commands in the form VERB NOUN, like this:
	
	TAKE APPLE[br]OPEN DOOR[br]TALK TO FRANCIS[br]THROW ROCK AT WINDOW
	
	There are, of course, many more things to do besides those listed above. If an action would make sense to do in any circumstance, give it a try! You never know when you might stumble into the solution to a puzzle.
	
	If you're brand new to IF, feel free to type COMMON COMMANDS at any time for a list of general actions that should usually work. If you're [i]not[/i] brand new (or even if you are), you might want to type COMMANDS sans the [']common['] to see a few unusual commands that are important in this game (this list may contain spoilers)."
	
Section 3 - Common Commands

Requesting command info is an action out of world. Understand "common commands" as requesting command info.

Report requesting command info:
	say "The first thing you want to do when starting any piece of IF is acquaint yourself with your surroundings. You should read the introductory text carefully. Pay attention to where you are. Notice which directions are available to go to, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them (X for short). You can (and should) examine just about everything[unicode 8212]even yourself! TAKE INVENTORY (or INVENTORY for short, [']I['] for shorter) will tell you what you're carrying, as well.
	
	Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from place to place, and check out every location available. At any given time, you are in a specific location in the game world. When you go to a new place, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and (sometimes) a list of directions you can go from there. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK ([']L['] for short).
	
	When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: e.g., GO NORTH. For simplicity's sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you may use NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST, or in short form N, S, E, and W. The program is capable of understanding additional directions, but they are not necessary in this game.
	
	Don't limit yourself to looking[unicode 8212]you can also try to LISTEN (or LISTEN TO), SMELL, TASTE, and TOUCH things. Sometimes you may not want to drop something directly on the ground. If that's the case, you could try to PUT it ON a surface, or INSERT it INTO a container. Speaking of, you might be able to OPEN or CLOSE certain things (like doors, cabinets, etc.). You may, at some point, find a device that you can SWITCH ON and then SWITCH OFF again.
	
	There are other, less common, actions available to you. When the time is right, you could try to ATTACK things, CLIMB things, CUT things, SIT ON things, LOCK or UNLOCK things, or LOOK UNDER things.
	
	There are a few simple commands for controlling the game itself. SAVE saves a snapshot of the game as it is now. RESTORE puts the game back to a previous saved state. You may keep as many saved games as you like. RESTART puts the game back to the way it was at the beginning. QUIT ends the game.
	
	This list might look overwhelming, but in the moment think of what makes sense to do[unicode 8212]as a wise uncle once said, 'doors are for opening; buttons are for pushing; pie is for eating.'"

Section 4 - Special Commands

Requesting the commands is an action out of world. Understand "commands" or "verbs" as requesting the commands.

After deciding the scope of the player while searching (this is the allow searching the location rule):
	place the location in scope.

After deciding the scope of the player while searching (this is the allow searching visible rooms rule):
	follow the scopable connectivity rule.
		
Rule for reaching inside a room (called the otherplace) while searching (this is the allow searching rooms rule):
	if the otherplace is connected with the location:
		allow access;
	otherwise:

Chapter 16 - Switching on and off

Setting action variables for switching on something which includes a switch (this is the adapted redirecting switches for switching on rule):
	if the noun is the oven:
		now the noun is the oven-switch;
	otherwise if the noun is the stove:
		now the noun is the stove-knobs;
	otherwise:
		let relevant switch be a random switch which is part of the noun;
		now the noun is the relevant switch.
		
Setting action variables for switching off something which includes a switch (this is the adapted redirecting switches for switching off rule):
	if the noun is the oven:

	otherwise if the noun is the stove:
		now the noun is the stove-knobs;

Report switching on a tap (this is the standard report switching taps on rule):
	say "[We] [turn] on [the noun]." (A) instead. [since "switch on" sounds weird in this context.]

Report switching off a tap (this is the standard report switching taps off rule):
	say "[We] [turn] off [the noun]." (A) instead.

Report someone switching on a tap (this is the standard report someone switching taps on rule):

Last check taking (this is the not worth carrying bulk rule):
	if the noun is bulky:
		say "[no time]It probably [if it's Nighttime]won't be[else]isn't[end if] worth carrying around something so bulky." (A) instead.
		
Before (this is the carry enclosed things rule):
	if action requires a carried noun:
		if the noun is not nothing and the player encloses the noun:
			if the player does not carry the noun:
				say "(first taking [the noun])[command clarification break]" (A);
				silently try taking the noun;
	if action requires a carried second noun:
		if the second noun is not nothing and the player encloses the second noun:
			if the player does not carry the second noun:
				say "(first taking [the second noun])[command clarification break]" (B);

Chapter 18 - Taking inventory

A thing can be previously-opened. A thing is seldom previously-opened. A supporter is usually previously-opened.

When play begins (this is the things that are open must have been previously opened rule):
	repeat with obj running through open things:
		now obj is previously-opened.

Carry out opening (this is the opening causes the noun to be previously opened rule):
	now the noun is previously-opened.

Instead of taking inventory (this is the customized inventory rule):
	let L be the list of things carried by the player;
	let M be the list of things worn by the player;
	repeat with obj running through L:
		if obj is listed in the list of parts unrecognized, remove obj from L;
		if obj is a PS-connector, remove obj from L;
		if obj is part of the smartphone, remove obj from L;
	if L is empty:
		if it's Nighttime:
			say "By that point, you won't be carrying anything. [nobr]";
		otherwise:
			say "You're not carrying anything. [nobr]";
	otherwise:
		say "[if it's Nighttime]By that point, you'll be[otherwise]You're[end if] carrying [L with indefinite articles]. [nobr]";
		let N be a list of things;
		let O be a list of things;
		repeat with that running through things enclosed by the player:
			if that is a container or that is a supporter:
				if the player carries that:
					add that to N;
				otherwise:
					add that to O;
		add O to N;
		repeat with X running from 1 to 3:
			repeat with obj running through N:
				[if obj is not a container and obj is not a supporter, remove obj from N;]
				if obj is a pocket, remove obj from N, if present;
			repeat with obj running through N:
				if obj is empty, remove obj from N, if present;
			repeat with obj running through N:
				unless obj is previously-opened, remove obj from N, if present;
			repeat with obj running through N:
				if obj is the keyring, remove obj from N, if present;
			repeat with obj running through N:
				if obj is the pill bottles, remove obj from N, if present;
			[remove the smartphone from N, if present;]
		unless N is empty:
			repeat with X running from 1 to the number of entries in N:
				let item be entry X of N;
				if X is 1:
					say "[if item is a supporter]On[otherwise]In[end if] [the item] [nobr]";
				otherwise:
					say "[if item is a supporter]on[otherwise]in[end if] [the item] [nobr]";
				if item is a container:
					say "[is-are a list of things in the item][nobr]";
				if item is a supporter:
					say "[is-are a list of things on the item][nobr]";
				if X is the number of entries in N:
					say ". [nobr]";
				otherwise if X is the number of entries in N minus 1:
					say "; and [nobr]";
				otherwise:
					say "; [nobr]";
	say paragraph break;
	say "[if L is empty]However[otherwise]Additionally[end if], [if it's Daytime]you're[otherwise]you'll be[end if] wearing [M with indefinite articles][nobr]";
	if the player wears the leather jacket and the jacket-pockets are not empty:
		say "; in the pockets of the leather jacket [is-are a list of things in the jacket-pockets][nobr]";
	if the player wears the trenchcoat and the coat-pockets are not empty:
		say "; in the pockets of the trenchcoat [is-are a list of things in the coat-pockets][nobr]";
	if the sweatpants-pockets are not empty:
		say ", and in the pockets of the sweatpants [is-are a list of things in the sweatpants-pockets].";
	otherwise:
		say "."
		
To add (X - value) to the end of (L - list of values):
	let N be the number of entries in L;
	increment N;
	add X at entry N in L.
	
To add (X - list of values) to the end of (L - list of values):
	let N be the number of entries in L;
	increment N;
	add X at entry N in L.
		
Chapter 19 - Waking

The customized block waking rule is listed instead of the block waking rule in the check waking rules.

This is the customized block waking rule:
	if the actor is the player:
		if the noun is a person:
			take no time;
			say "[The noun] [if it's Daytime]is already clearly[otherwise]will already clearly be[end if] awake." (A) instead;
		otherwise if the noun is a device:
			try switching on the noun instead;
		otherwise:
			take no time;
			say "That seems[if it's Nighttime] like it would be[end if] unnecessary." (B) instead;
	stop the action.

Chapter 20 - Stuff with keys

The extended limiting keychains rule is listed instead of the limiting keychains rule in the instead rules.

Instead of putting something which is not keyish on a keychain (this is the extended limiting keychains rule):
	say "[The noun] [are] not a key." (A).
	
Definition: a thing is keyish:
	if it is a passkey, decide yes;
	if it is a latchkey, decide yes;
	decide no.

Last every turn (this is the everyone is subtle by default rule):
	now the intruder is being subtle;
	now the player is being subtle.

Before an actor noisy behavior (this is the behaving noisily rule):
	now the actor is being noisy;
	continue the action.
	
Before an actor obvious behavior (this is the behaving obviously rule):
	now the actor is being obvious;
	continue the action.
	
[NOTE: the below is adapted from example 408 - 'Timeless' from the Inform Recipe Book]
	
Taking inventory is acting fast. Remembering is acting fast. Ruminating about something is acting fast. Waking up is acting fast. Thinking is acting fast. Crying is acting fast. Dancing is acting fast. Magicking is acting fast. Enchanting something is acting fast. Praying is acting fast. Screaming is acting fast. Singing is acting fast. Winning is acting fast.

Chapter 4 - Software on the phone

Section 1 - Lockscreen

The smartphone runs a password-lock program called lockscreen.
The description of lockscreen is "A factory preset wallpaper [regarding the smartphone][appear] on the screen briefly before giving way to a number pad and an invitation to type a six-digit passcode[first time]. Brookwood told you the passcode would be your birth month and year: December 1994[only]."
The password of lockscreen is "121994". [NOTE: PC's birthday month & year.]
The rejection of lockscreen is "[passcode-attempts up]The phone [regarding the smartphone][vibrate] slightly. The screen [read] 'Password incorrect' briefly, before the number pad reappears."
The success of lockscreen is "[passcode-attempts reset]The phone [regarding the smartphone][vibrate] slightly, and the password field [vanish]."

[After reading a command (this is the no need to specify the number pad rule):
	if the player's command includes "on number pad":
		cut the matched text.]

To say passcode-attempts up: increment the passcode-attempts of the smartphone.
To say passcode-attempts reset: now the passcode-attempts of the smartphone is 0.

The default typing rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Player-inputting is a truth state that varies. player-inputting is true.
This is the reset inputting party rule: now player-inputting is true.
The reset inputting party rule is listed first in the turn sequence rules.

Carry out an actor typing the topic understood on a keyboard which is part of a computer (this is the customized typing rule):
	unless the actor is the player:
		now player-inputting is false;
	abide by the input handling rules for the software in question.

An input handling rule for lockscreen (this is the customized check for correct lockscreen password rule):
	let N be "[the topic understood]"; 
	if N is the password of lockscreen:
		carry out the rewarding successful answering activity with lockscreen;
		rule succeeds;
	otherwise:
		if the passcode-attempts of the smartphone is 6:
			if player-inputting is true:
				say "The phone [vibrate] slightly, and the number pad [disappear]. In its place [are] some text:
			
				[pt]There have been too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock this phone. It has been temporarily disabled. Please try again in [remaining time of disabled-screen] minutes.[/pt]";
			otherwise:
				follow the extended report the intruder typing on the smartphone rule;
			now the smartphone is locked;
			now the smartphone does not run lockscreen;
			now the software priority of disabled-screen is 1;
		otherwise if player-inputting is true:
			say "[rejection of lockscreen][paragraph break]" (A);
		otherwise:
			follow the extended report the intruder typing on the smartphone rule;
		rule fails.

Last every turn (this is the lock the phone when it's off rule):
	if the smartphone is switched off:
		[reset to home screen;]
		now the smartphone runs lockscreen.

The smartphone runs some software called disabled-screen. The software priority of disabled-screen is 10. 
disabled-screen has a number called the remaining time. The remaining time of disabled-screen is 60.
The description of disabled-screen is "The screen remains blank except for some text that reads:

[pt]There have been too many unsuccessful attempts to unlock this phone. It has been temporarily disabled. Please try again in [remaining time of disabled-screen] minutes.[/pt]".

Every turn when the smartphone is locked (this is the count down on the disabled screen rule):
	decrement the remaining time of disabled-screen;
	if the remaining time of disabled-screen is 0:
		now the smartphone is unlocked;
		now the smartphone runs lockscreen;
		now the software priority of disabled-screen is 10;
		now the remaining time of disabled-screen is 60.
		
Definition: the smartphone is protected:
	if it runs a password-lock program, yes;
	if the software priority of disabled-screen is 1, yes;
	no.

The invitation is a metaphor. It is part of  lockscreen.
Before doing something other than remembering when the current action involves the invitation: say "It [regarding the invitation][aren't] a literal pen-and-paper invitation[unicode 8212]just text on the screen." instead.

Instead of remembering the invitation: say "[nnt][as the parser]The last time [we] [saw] the smartphone and its inviting lockscreen, it [was-were of smartphone] [if the remembered location of the smartphone is either Main-Behind-Shelf or Main-By-Counter]by [otherwise if the remembered location of the smartphone is a room]in [otherwise][end if][if the remembered location of smartphone is a room][casual descriptor of the remembered location of smartphone][otherwise][at the remembered location of smartphone][end if].[as normal][line break]".

Section 2 - Homescreen

The smartphone runs a multiple-choice program called homescreen. The options table of the homescreen is the Table of Homescreen Options. The software priority of homescreen is 3.
The description of homescreen is "[customized homescreen options-list]".
The out-of-bounds response of a multiple-choice program is usually "[Our] selection, '[topic understood]', [if it's Daytime]is not[otherwise]won't be[end if] one of the available choices."

To say customized homescreen options-list:
	say "[one of]A second factory-preset wallpaper [if it's Nighttime]will appear[otherwise]appears[end if], overlaid with[or]The screen [if it's Nighttime]will display[otherwise]displays[end if][stopping] the following apps:[/p]";
	repeat through the options table of homescreen:
		say "[title entry][br]";
	say "[run paragraph on]".

			say "[We] [return] to the home screen.";
			try examining homescreen;
		otherwise:
			reset to operating system;
			say "[We] [close] the window and return to the desktop.";
			try examining LaptopOS;
		rule succeeds.
		
After reading a command (this is the closing apps equates to tapping close rule):
	if the smartphone is switched on and the smartphone is unprotected and the player encloses the smartphone:

	if the location of user is the location of the laptop-computer and the laptop-computer is switched on, decide yes;
	decide no.
		
To reset to home screen:
	repeat with item running through software run by the smartphone:
		unless item is either homescreen or lockscreen or disabled-screen:
			now the software priority of item is 5.
	
After examining a quittable software (called chosen software) (this is the alert the player to quittability rule):
	if chosen software is run by smartphone:
		say "You can also CLOSE the app to return to the home screen.";
	otherwise:
		say "You can also select QUIT to return to the operating system."
		
The factory is a metaphor. It is part of homescreen. Understand "preset" or "factory-preset" as the factory.
Before doing something other than remembering when the current action involves the factory: say "Factory-preset, as in default[unicode 8212]not a literal factory." instead.

Instead of remembering the invitation: say "[nnt][as the parser]The last time [we] [saw] the smartphone and its factory-preset wallpaper, it [was-were of smartphone] [if the remembered location of the smartphone is either Main-Behind-Shelf or Main-By-Counter]by [otherwise if the remembered location of the smartphone is a room]in [otherwise][end if][if the remembered location of smartphone is a room][casual descriptor of the remembered location of smartphone][otherwise][at the remembered location of smartphone][end if].[as normal][line break]".

Section 3 - Safe

The safe is a scenery container in Main-Sitting. It is closed, locked, and openable. The bulk-capacity of the safe is 20.
The description of the safe is "A metal [safe] embedded in the wall[if closed], with a dial on the front[end if]. [if it's Daytime]Currently, it stands[otherwise]By that point, it will be standing[end if] [openness of the safe]."
[The safe has some text called the code. The code of the safe is "12 4 19 94".]
The safe has a list of numbers called the current combination.
The safe has a list of numbers called the true combination. The true combination of the safe is { 12, 4, 19, 94 }.
[NOTE: The code dealing with the combination, some of which is from the Cookbook and some of which I wrote, is meant to give the player the most flexibility possible when trying to open the safe.]

"1241994" or "12041994"

Carry out looking when the location is Main-Sitting (this is the announce the safe rule):
	unless the painting is hung-up:
		say "A metal [safe][first time], previously hidden by the painting,[only] [are] embedded in the wall, under a [nail]."
		
Instead of remembering the safe:
	if the painting is not handled, try remembering the painting;
	otherwise say "That, you expect, [regarding the noun][remain] embedded in the wall in the sitting area."
		
The announce the safe rule is listed after the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules.

Before doing something when the current action involves the safe (this is the painting blocks the safe rule):
	if the painting is hung-up and the painting is visible:
		say "[nnt]The painting [if it's Daytime]is currently[otherwise]will be[end if] hung up[if it's Nighttime] at that point[end if], concealing the safe entirely and preventing any interaction with it." instead;
	otherwise:
		continue the action.

After examining the safe: say indicate-combination.

To say indicate-combination: say "[first time]Brookwood told you the combination was four numbers long, and that those four number were your birth date: December 4th, 1994. You suspect you'll have to break the year into two numbers, since the dial only goes from 0 to 99. You can SPIN the dial of the safe TO each number.[only]".

Instead of examining the safe when the number of entries in the current combination of the safe > 0: follow the indicate combination so far rule.

This is the indicate combination so far rule:
	say "[We] [have][if it's Nighttime], by that time,[end if] dialed the safe to [the current combination of the safe]. ";
	say paragraph break;

Before spinning the safe to (this is the only allow spinning to numbers 0 or higher rule):
	if the number understood < 0:
		take no time;
		say "The numbers on the safe begin at 0[if it's Nighttime], if you remember correctly[end if]. The combination is 12 4 19 94, so you [if it's Daytime]don't[otherwise]wouldn't[end if] need a negative number anyway." instead.

Instead of spinning the safe to the number understood (this is the mechanism for entering the safe's combination rule):
	truncate the current combination of the safe to the last 3 entries;
	add the number understood to the current combination of the safe;
	if the safe is locked and the current combination of the safe is the true combination of the safe:
		say "[We] [dial] [the number understood], and [the noun] [unlock] with a [i]snick[/i].";

	otherwise if the safe is unlocked and the safe is closed and the current combination of the safe is not the true combination of the safe:
		truncate the current combination of the safe to 0 entries;
		say "[We] [spin] the dial, and [the noun] [snick] locked.";
		now the safe is locked;
	otherwise:
		say "[We] [dial] [the number understood] on the safe."
		
After reading a command (this is the replace slashes with dashes rule):
	let comm be "[the player's command]";
	while comm matches the regular expression "(\d)\/(\d)":
		replace the regular expression "(\d)\/(\d)" in comm with "\1-\2";
	change the text of the player's command to comm.
		
Instead of setting the safe to the topic understood (this is the mechanism for entering the combination all at once rule):
	let X be "[the topic understood]";
	if the topic understood is a topic listed in the Table of Potential Safe Codes:
		truncate the current combination of the safe to 0 entries;
		repeat with N running from 1 to 4:
			add entry N of the true combination of the safe to the current combination of the safe;
		if the safe is locked:
			say "[We] [dial] the combination, and [the noun] [unlock] with a [i]snick[/i].";
			now the safe is unlocked;
		otherwise:

	otherwise if X matches the regular expression "\D":
		say "The safe only accepts numbers[if it's Nighttime], if you remember correctly[end if].";
	otherwise:
		say say "[We] [dial] the numbers on the safe, but nothing [happen]."
		
Carry out opening the safe (this is the reset the combination upon opening the safe rule): truncate the current combination of the safe to 0 entries.
Carry out closing the safe: now the safe is locked.

Report closing the safe: say "[We] [close] [the safe], and it [snick] locked." instead.

A stack of moving boxes is a container in Main-Sitting. "[A stack of moving boxes][first time], their contents as-of-yet unloaded,[only] [languish] in one corner." It is eclipsing, bulky, fixed in place, closed, and openable. Understand "box" or "top one/box" as the stack of moving boxes. The bulk-capacity of the stack of moving boxes is 20.
Understand "top" as the stack of moving boxes when the location is Main-Sitting.
The description of the stack of moving boxes is "The[first time] intimidatingly-large[only] set of boxes whose contents you didn't get to today. Better luck tomorrow, kid. [if it's Daytime]Currently, the[otherwise]The[end if] top one [if it's Daytime]stands[otherwise]will be[end if] [openness of the stack of moving boxes][if it's Nighttime] by that point[end if]."

Does the player mean doing something to the stack of moving boxes:
	if the location is Main-Sitting, it is possible;
	it is unlikely.

Rule for printing the name of the stack of moving boxes while examining or searching:
	if the location is Main-Sitting, say "the top box of the stack";

Instead of giving something to the stack of moving boxes: try inserting the noun into the stack of moving boxes.

Instead of looking under the stack of moving boxes:
	if it's Daytime, say "You stacked them yourself and know that there's only floor underneath. It would be too much work to move them and check.";
	otherwise say "You know for a fact you would only find the floor underneath, and suspect double checking would be a waste of time under the circumstances.";

Instead of throwing something at the stack of moving boxes: say "[no time]Once you identify the impulse, [we] [find] you have no reason to actually follow through."

Some plural-boxes are privately-named scenery. They are part of the stack of moving boxes.

After starting the virtual machine (this is the pluralize the stack of moving boxes rule):
	dispatch everything but {  } for the plural-boxes to the stack of moving boxes;
	
Before doing something when the current action involves the stack of moving boxes (this is the set plural pronouns for the stack of moving boxes rule):
	set pronouns from the stack of moving boxes;
	set pronouns from the plural-boxes;

Section 2 - Inside

The box-junk is junk in the stack of moving boxes.

Does the player mean doing something to the box-junk:
	if the location is not Main-Sitting, it is very unlikely;
	it is possible.

The radio is a switched off device in the stack of moving boxes. The bulk of the radio is 5. The radio is incapacitating and electronic.
The description of the radio is "An old, beat-up looking radio. You loved it as a kid, so your father let you claim it when you moved out.

[if it's Daytime]It seems to be[otherwise]If you remember right, it's[end if] only capable of tuning to whole-number stations[unicode 8212]it can find 100 or 101, but not 100.5."
The radio can be shattered or intact. The radio is intact. Understand the shattered property as describing the radio.
The radio has a number called the current station. The current station of the radio is 98.
The radio has some text called the output. The output of the radio is "[only-static]".

To say only-static: say "The radio [if it's Daytime][one of]emits[or][emits][stopping][otherwise]will be [one of]emitting[or][emitting][stopping][end if] [one of]only [or][if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds]only [end if][stopping]static."

To say emits: say "[one of]emits[or]plays[or]produces[as decreasingly likely outcomes]".
To say emitting: say "[one of]emitting[or]playing[or]producing[as decreasingly likely outcomes]".

Definition: the radio is listenable:
	if the radio is switched on:
		if the radio is enclosed by the location, decide yes;
		if the radio is enclosed by a room adjacent to the location, decide yes;
		decide no;
	decide no.

Carry out an actor switching on the radio:
	now the radio is noisemaking;
	if intruder-inside is true and the annoyance is nothing:
		now the annoyance is the radio;
	increase the ambient noise of the location of the radio.

Carry out an actor switching off the radio:
	now the radio is soundless;
	if the annoyance is the radio:
		now the annoyance is nothing;
	decrease the ambient noise of the location of the radio.

This is the radio makes noise rule:
	if the radio is switched on and radio-listened is false:
		if the radio is listenable:
			say the output of the radio;
		otherwise:
			if the output of the radio is "[only-static]":
				say "[We] [hear], faintly, the radio [emitting] static.";
			otherwise:
				say "[We] [hear] indistinct noise [one of]coming from[or]emitting from[or]playing on[as decreasingly likely outcomes] the radio."

The radio makes noise rule is listed before the make atmosphere happen rule in the every turn rules.

Carry out an actor going (this is the moving changes which room the radio makes noise in rule):
	if the actor encloses the radio and the radio is switched on:
		decrease the ambient noise of the room gone from;
		increase the ambient noise of the room gone to;
		now the actor is being noisy.

Check setting the radio numerically to the number understood (this is the most stations are static rule):
	unless the number understood is a station listed in the Table of Radio Stations:
		now the current station of the radio is the number understood;
		now the output of the radio is "[only-static]";
		if it's Daytime and the radio is switched on:
			say "There doesn't appear to be a station at that frequency." (A) instead;
		otherwise:
			say "As far as you know, there's no station at that frequency[if the radio is switched off]. No way to tell for sure, with the radio off[end if]." (B) instead. 
			
Carry out setting the radio numerically to (this is the standard setting the radio to rule):
	now the current station of the radio is the number understood;

[NOTE: All code dealing with the Table of Things Stolen and its associated functions, similar to the tutorial goals, is adapted from Achievements by Juhana Leinonen]
Table of Things Stolen
item	stolen-flag	verification
important documents	0	documents-stolen rule
jewellery box	0	jewelry-stolen rule
laptop-computer	0	laptop-stolen rule
smartphone	0	smartphone-stolen rule
taser	0	taser-stolen rule
vase	0	vase-stolen rule
wallet	0	wallet-stolen rule

This is the documents-stolen rule: if the important documents are in the rucksack, rule succeeds.
This is the jewelry-stolen rule: if the jewellery box is in the rucksack, rule succeeds.
This is the laptop-stolen rule: if the laptop-computer is in the rucksack, rule succeeds.
This is the smartphone-stolen rule: if the smartphone is in the rucksack, rule succeeds.
This is the taser-stolen rule: if the intruder encloses the taser, rule succeeds.
This is the vase-stolen rule: if the vase is in the rucksack, rule succeeds.
This is the wallet-stolen rule: if the wallet is in the rucksack, rule succeeds.

This is the check for stolen things rule:
	repeat through the Table of Things Stolen:
		if (there is no stolen-flag entry or the stolen-flag entry is 0) and there is a verification entry:
			follow the verification entry;
			if the rule succeeded:
				mark the item entry stolen.
	
The check for stolen things rule is listed last in the turn sequence rules.

To mark the/-- (obj - thing) stolen:
	if there is an item of obj in the Table of Things Stolen:
		choose the row with item of obj in the Table of Things Stolen;
		if there is no stolen-flag entry or the stolen-flag entry is 0:
			now the stolen-flag entry is 1.

To decide whether (obj - thing) has/have been stolen:
	if there is an item of obj in the Table of Things Stolen:
		choose the row with item of obj in the Table of Things Stolen;
		if there is a stolen-flag entry and the stolen-flag entry is 1, decide yes;
		decide no;
	decide no.

To decide which number is the count of stolen things:
	let N be 0;
	repeat through the Table of Things Stolen:
		if the stolen-flag entry is 1:
			increment N;
	decide on N.
	
Section 5 - Litigiously

Nighttime ends litigiously when Officer Raphael is in Entryway.

Police En Route is a scene. Police En Route begins when 911-texted is true. Police En Route ends when Nighttime ends.

When Police En Route begins:
	sirens sound in 20 minutes from now;
	police arrive in 28 minutes from now;
	police announce themselves in 29 minutes from now.
	
At the time when sirens sound: say "You will hear the whoop of a police siren on the street below. They will be near. You'll only have to hold out a little longer."

At the time when police arrive: now Officer Raphael is in down-the-hall.

At the time when police announce themselves: say "A loud voice will call 'POLICE!' from the hallway. Then, 'I'M COMING IN!'"

This is the Raphael barges in rule:
	if Officer Raphael is not in green room:
		have Officer Raphael plan an action for being-in with Officer Raphael and Entryway.
		
The Raphael barges in rule is listed after the advance time rule in the turn sequence rules.

When Nighttime ends litigiously:
	record "Ending IV: Police intervened" as an ending;
	say "A police officer will barge into the apartment and subdue the intruder. In your mind, she will be a woman. You choose not to consider the chance that she will mistake you for the criminal, or that she will enact any extrajudicial violence on either of you. But even if everything goes perfectly, your troubles will not yet be over.
	
	Your situation will have changed: you'll no longer be a victim in mortal danger, but instead a woman going by a false name with a police officer in her apartment. You've talked your way out of tricky situations before, but this will be quite the hill to climb.
	
	Do you consider this an acceptable outcome? > [run paragraph on]";
	if the player consents:
		follow the enact the plan rule;
	otherwise:
		follow the lukewarm reject the plan rule.
	
Section 6 - Murderously & Criminally

Carry out assaulting the intruder with: if the second noun is deadly, now the intruder is dead.

Report assaulting the intruder with a charging cable:
	say "You will sneak up behind him and, quick as a viper, wrap [the second noun] around his neck. He will have size and strength, but you will have the element of surprise and the ability to breathe.
	
	It will not be quick[unicode 8212]you know, even if only intellectually, that real-life suffocation is nothing like it is in the movies. He will write and buck and choke. Blood vessels in his eyes will burst. His hands will grasp and claw at yours, at the cable, at his own face. Your arms will burn and your temple will throb, but you will have no choice but to hold strong.
	
	And then finally, he will be still."

Report assaulting the intruder with the chef's knife: follow the stabbing rule.
Report assaulting the intruder with the paring knife: follow the stabbing rule.

This is the stabbing rule:
	if potentially-ranged is true:
		say "You will line up your shot and throw [the second noun]. It will bounce off of his back point-first, making only the smallest of cuts. He will wheel around with a cry of outrage, but you will already be racing forward. You will retrieve the knife from the ground and thrust it upwards, under his ribs.
		
		You will let go of the handle as he bends over double, some important organ ruptured by the knife. His eyes will lock with yours. This time, though, it will be over for [i]him[/i]. The life will drain from him quickly as his blood seeps out around the blade.
		
		His face will be a mask of shock, but he will make no more noise. He will go limp, collapsing to the floor, and lay still.";
	otherwise:
		say "You will sneak up behind him, brandishing [the second noun]. As silently as you can, you will take him by the shoulder and thrust the knife into his back.
		
		You know it's likely to catch on his ribs, and you know that it will still surprise you when it does. Still, you trust adrenaline to help you wrench it back out. He will cry out only once it leaves his body, then wheel around to face you. His eyes will lock with yours. This time, though, it will be over for [i]him[/i]. You will adjust your grip and plunge the knife into his heart.
		
		His face will be a mask of shock, but he will make no more noise. He will go limp, sliding off of the knife and onto the floor, and lay still."
		
Report assaulting the intruder with the meat cleaver:
	if potentially-ranged is true:
		say "You will line up your shot and throw meat cleaver. It will bounce off of his back, not doing much damage. He will wheel around with a cry of outrage, but you will already be racing forward. You will retrieve the cleaver from the ground and swing it into the back of his knee.
		
		He will crumple to one side even as you draw back and swing again, the blade biting into his neck. Warm blood will spurt over your hand as you hack and hack and hack, deepening the wound. This time, though, it will be over for [i]him[/i]. The life will drain from him quickly as his blood spurts from the gash in his neck.
		
		His face will be a mask of shock, but he will make no more noise. He will go limp, collapsing to the floor, and lay still.";
	otherwise:
		say "You will sneak up behind him, brandishing the meat cleaver. As silently as you can, you will take him by the shoulder and swing the knife into his neck.
		
		You know it will stick a bit in the meat, and you know that it will still surprise you when it does. Still, you trust adrenaline to help you wrench it back out. He will gurgle as it leaves his body, but already will be losing too much blood to do much of anything. You will hack and hack and hack until, finally, you will take his head clean off.
		
		The rest of his body will collapse to the floor, as you hold the head up by the hair. You will turn it towards you. The face will be a mask of shock, the eyes wide and the mouth slack. This time, it will be over for [i]him[/i]."

Report assaulting the intruder with the taser:
	say "You will sneak up behind the intruder, quietly as you can. Once you're in range, you will stick the taser into his neck and switch it on.
	
	His body will seize. You will keep the taser pressed to his neck. His mouth will foam. You will keep the taser right there. You will hold it there until his muffled groans stop, even as his body continues to twitch. Only once you're sure he's good and dead will you let him crumple to the ground."

Report assaulting the intruder with the screwdriver:
	now potentially-ranged is true;
	say "You will sneak up behind the intruder, quietly as you can. Once you're right behind him, you will slip the screwdriver from your back pocket and stab it into his neck.
		
	Blood will spurt from the wound with surprising force. It will coat your face and hands, thick and hot. He will try to scream, but the noise will turn to a gurgle as the blood seeps into his windpipe. He will turn, grasping at the handle but unable to remove it.
	
	His eyes will lock with yours. This time, though, it will be over for [i]him[/i]. They will roll back into his head as he collapses to the floor, twitching. Finally, he will lie still."
	
Report assaulting the intruder with the pillow:
	say "With a roar, you will rush him. He will have the size advantage, but you will have the element of surprise. You will knock him prone and press the pillow to his face.
	
	He will buck and thrash, but you will pin his arms with your knees. The gun will discharge, but miss. It will be so, so hard to hold him down until he falls still, but you will have to.
	
	When you remove the pillow, his lips will be tinged blue. His hand will be frozen curled into claws. His eyes will be wide and full of anger, even in death."

[Report assaulting the intruder with the umbrella:
	if potentially-ranged is true:
		say ".";
	otherwise:
		say "."]

Instead of assaulting the intruder with the stove: try assaulting the intruder with the burners.
Report assaulting the intruder with the burners:
	say "With a roar, you will race up to him. He will have size and strength, but you will have the element of surprise. You will tackle him bodily and slam his face down onto the stovetop.
	
	Your nose will be immediately accosted by the smell of burning flesh. The intruder will scream and thrash, but you will brace your legs against the counter opposite and hold him down.";

You will wait for an opportune moment, then surge [if knife-holder is a room]down [end if]to grab it.
		
		As he's still reeling and struggling to stand up, you will take him by the shoulder and plunge [the appropriate-knife] into his chest. You know it's likely to catch on his ribs, and you know that it will still surprise you when it does. Still, you will remove the knife, adjust the angle, and plunge it home.

		Blood will spurt from the wound with surprising force. It will coat your face and hands, thick and hot. His screams will turn to gurgles as it seeps into his windpipe. He will thrash a moment longer, but his strength will soon wane. Finally, he will lie still.";
	otherwise:
		say "You will hold him there until his skin melts. You will hold him there until his screams cease. You will hold him there until he stops twitching, and then you will let his body slide to the floor."

Report assaulting the intruder with the gun:
	say "You will take careful aim. Beathe in, breathe out, and squeeze.
	
	The rapport will be impossibly loud. Your ears will ring in the moments after, and it will certainly draw the attention of any awake neighbors. But it will only take one shot."
	
The no pushing the intruder rule does nothing when the location is Main-Behind-Shelf and the windows are shattered.
The can't push people rule does nothing when the location is Main-Behind-Shelf and the windows are shattered.

intruder-pushed is a truth state that varies. intruder-pushed is false.

Carry out pushing the intruder:
	now intruder-pushed is true;
	now the intruder is dead.

First report pushing the intruder:
	say "With a roar, you will race up to him and give him a hard shove. His eyes will go wide, his arms pinwheeling comically as he tries to keep his balance. Ultimately, he will fail, and with a long scream he will plummet from the window.
	
	You will peer out of the window and catch the very end of his fall. You will see his body impact on the sidewalk and hear the thud. You will see the initial spray of gore from his head, and watch as blood pools from under his body. He will not move again." instead.

Nighttime ends murderously when the intruder is dead and 911-texted is false.

When Nighttime ends murderously:
	record "Ending V: Murdered the intruder" as an ending;
	if intruder-pushed is false:
		follow the intro murder rule;

Section 1 - Jumping from the window

player-jumped is a truth state that varies. player-jumped is false.

Check jumping during Nighttime (this is the convert from jumping to jumping out of the windows rule):
	if the location is Main-Behind-Shelf and the windows are shattered:
		now player-jumped is true.
		
The report jumping rule does nothing when player-jumped is true.

After reading a command (this is the simplify jumping out the windows rule):

Section 2 - Recognizing the intruder

Recognizing is an action applying to one thing. Understand "recognize [any thing]" or "recognise [any thing]" or "identify [any thing]" as recognizing.

Rule for reaching inside a room while recognizing (this is the allow distant recognizing rule):
	allow access.

Check recognizing:
	unless the noun is the intruder:
		if the noun is visible, try examining the noun instead;
		otherwise try remembering the noun instead.
		
Check recognizing the intruder:
	if intruder-inside is false:
		take no time;
		say "He won't yet have gotten inside, so you won't have had the chance to get a good look at him." instead.
		
The intruder can be recognized or unrecognized. The intruder is unrecognized.

Carry out recognizing the intruder: now the intruder is recognized.

Nighttime ends awkwardly when the intruder is recognized.

When Nighttime ends awkwardly:
	say "Wait a second.";

	'Miss DeCesare!' she'll reply, a notable quaver in her voice. 'I didn't think you were staying here tonight.'
	
	'What are you doing here?' you'll ask, doing your best to keep your own voice steady.
	
	'I just-' she will consider what to say. 'I don't sleep much, and I remembered there were reports of some potential broken glass in the unit, and I just wanted to make sure it was all tidied up for you. I didn't think you would be sleeping here until tomorrow.'
	
	'Yeah, I swept that up earlier,' you will reply.

		remove the shadows from play;
	if intruder-inside is false:
		streamline the search;
		now intruder-inside is true.
	
Every turn during Nighttime (this is the run the intruder state machine rule): 
	if intruder-inside is false and the time since Nighttime began > one minute:
		if the front door is locked:
			now the activity-state of the intruder is cracking-lock;
		otherwise:
			now the activity-state of the intruder is on-the-move;
		have the intruder plan an action for being-in with the intruder and Entryway;
	otherwise:
		follow the Intruder State Rules.
		
Planning when the desired relation is being-in and the desired param1 is the planning actor and the desired param2 is a room (this is the advanced travel with best route rule):

Remaining Concealed ends elusively when the player is not potentially concealed.

When Remaining Concealed ends unfortunately:
	say "[one of]Numb from being still for so long, your leg will spasm and knock against the floor. There'll be no way he won't have heard it[or]You will be unable to suppress a whimper. There'll be no way he won't have heard it[or]Suddenly, your stomach will growl. It won't be very loud, but you'll know it will be enough to alert the intruder to your location[or]Your knee will knock against [the random thing incorporating the holder of the player]. There'll be no way he won't have heard that[or]Surprising yourself as much as anyone, you will let out a fart. It will only be a quiet thing, but you'll know it will be enough to alert the intruder to your location[in random order].";

Part 4 - Reporting his actions

Chapter 1 - Restrictions and allowances for reporting

A player's action awareness rule (this is the player aware of noise rule):
	if the player is not the actor and the actor is being noisy, rule succeeds.
	
A player's action awareness rule (this is the player aware of nearby people rule):
	if the player is not the actor and the actor is around [and the actor is being obvious], rule succeeds.

Chapter 2 - General action reporting

intruder-action-reported is a truth state that varies. intruder-action-reported is false.
First before: now intruder-action-reported is false.

To say in-by intruder locale descriptor:
	if the location of the intruder is either Main-Behind-Shelf or Main-By-Counter:
		say "by [nobr]";
	otherwise:
		say "in [nobr]";
	say the casual descriptor of the location of the intruder.
	
to say noise-mod:
	if the location of the intruder is not the location:
		if the location is Entryway:
			if the location of the intruder is Bathroom:
				say noise-modifier of Bathroom;
			otherwise if the location of the intruder is Outside Hall:
				say noise-modifier of Outside Hall;
			otherwise if the location of the intruder is Within-Closet:
				say noise-modifier of Within-Closet;
		otherwise if the location is Bathroom or the location of the intruder is Bathroom:
			say noise-modifier of Bathroom;
		otherwise if the location is Outside Hall or the location of the intruder is Outside Hall:
			say noise-modifier of Outside Hall;
		otherwise if the location is Within-Closet or the location of the intruder is Within-Closet:
			say noise-modifier of Within-Closet.
	
To say vague intruder direction:
	let loc be the location of the intruder;
	if loc is the location:
		say "nearby";
	otherwise:
		choose a row with an other place of loc in the relative direction set of the location;
		say "[descriptor entry]".
	
To say intruder locale descriptor: say the casual descriptor of the location of the intruder.

This is the effective listening closely rule:
	if player-listening is true, follow the listening closely rules.
	
The effective listening closely rule is listed after the run the intruder state machine rule in the every turn rules.

The listening closely rules are a rulebook.

intended-act is a kind of value. The intended-acts are computer-typing, dial-spinning, going-place, inserting-in, letting-drop, lockpicking, looking-around, looking-through, opening-up, peering-behind, peering-under, phone-typing, picking-up, putting-upon, shutting-it, staring-at, turning-on, placeholder-action.

The intruder has an intended-act called the intended-action. The intended-action of the intruder is placeholder-action.

The first listening closely rule (this is the fiddling with the lock rule):
	if intruder-inside is false:
		if the front door is unlocked:
			say "You will hold your breath and listen intently. In the silence, you will hear the front door creaking open.";
		otherwise:
			say "You will hold your breath and listen intently. In the silence, you will faintly hear whoever is outside fiddling with the front door's lock.";
		now player-listening is false;
		rule succeeds;
	make no decision.
	
player-listening is a truth state that varies. player-listening is false.
	
A listening closely rule (this is the force reporting rule):
	unless the intruder is in the location, now player-listening is true.

[TODO: Test and refine]
	
The last listening closely rule (this is the won't hear anything rule):
	if player-listening is false:
		say "You will hold your breath and listen intently, but won't be able to make out any clear noises."
	
This is the reward listening closely rule:
	if Nighttime is happening and player-listening is true:
		if the intended-action of the intruder is dial-spinning:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] a clicking sound [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is going-place:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] [the intruder] moving around [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is inserting-in:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] a faint rustling [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is letting-drop:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] something fall to the ground [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is lockpicking:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] something unlocking [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is opening-up:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] something open [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is putting-upon:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] a faint impact [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is shutting-it:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] something close [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is turning-on:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] something switch on [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is computer-typing:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] a typing sound [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intended-action of the intruder is phone-typing:
			say "[We] [hear][noise-mod] a tapping sound [vague intruder direction].";
		otherwise if the intruder-action-num is 0:
			say "You will hold your breath and listen intently, but won't be able to make out any clear noises.";
		otherwise if intruder-action-reported is false:
			follow the Faraway Reporting rulebook for the intruder-action-num;
	now the intended-action of the intruder is placeholder-action.
	
This is the reset listening rule: now player-listening is false.
	
The reward listening closely rule is listed before the advance time rule in the turn sequence rules.
The reset listening rule is listed after the reward listening closely rule in the turn sequence rules.

Instead of listening to nothing: try listening to the location.

First every turn: now the relevant item is nothing.

Carry out the intruder closing (this is the set intruder's intention to close rule):
